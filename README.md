# flutter_sleepcycle

A new Flutter project.

## Sleep audio classification

This project now includes a simple on-device classifier that processes the
recorded WAV file and detects snoring, coughs, apnea-like silence and speech.
Recordings are saved as `*.wav` files so that they can be analyzed without
an internet connection.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
